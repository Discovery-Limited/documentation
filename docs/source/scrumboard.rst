Introduction
------------

This document provides an overview of the Scrum Board, a visual tool used in Agile project management to track and manage tasks.

What is a Scrumboard?
-----------------------
The Scrumboard is a visual management tool commonly used in Agile software development methodologies, particularly within Scrum frameworks. Its primary purpose is to help teams organize, prioritize, and track their work throughout a project's lifecycle.

The Scrumboard typically consists of columns representing different stages of the development process (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done), with tasks displayed as cards within these columns. This visual layout makes it easy for team members to understand the status of tasks at a glance.

Why Use a Scrumboard?
--------------------
1. **Visual Representation**: The Scrumboard provides a visual representation of the project's workflow, making it easy for team members to understand the status of tasks at a glance.

2. **Transparency and Collaboration**: By displaying tasks and their statuses in a central location, the Scrumboard promotes transparency within the team, encouraging collaboration and communication among team members.

3. **Flexibility and Adaptability**: Scrumboards are highly flexible and can be easily adapted to fit the specific needs of a project or team. This adaptability allows teams to respond quickly to changing requirements or priorities.

4. **Focus on Deliverables**: With tasks organized into clear columns, team members can focus on completing work and moving tasks through the workflow, enhancing productivity and project delivery.

Using a Scrumboard can streamline project management processes, improve team collaboration, and ultimately lead to more successful project outcomes in Agile development environments.

Our Features
------------

- Task cards: Each task is represented by a card on the Scrum Board.
- Columns: The board is divided into columns representing different stages of the project, such as "Backlog", "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."
- Drag and drop: Tasks can be easily moved between columns by dragging and dropping the cards.
- Task details: Each card contains information about the task, such as its title, assignee, and due date.

Usage
-----

To use the Scrum Board effectively, follow these steps:

1. Create task cards for each task in the project.
2. Place the cards in the appropriate column based on their current status.
3. Update the status of tasks by moving the cards between columns.
4. Collaborate with team members by assigning tasks and adding comments to the cards.
5. Monitor the progress of the project by reviewing the Scrum Board regularly.

Conclusion
----------

The Scrum Board is a valuable tool for Agile teams to visualize and manage their tasks. By using this board, teams can improve collaboration, track progress, and ensure timely completion of project tasks.

Next Steps
----------

Now that you have a basic understanding of the Scrum Board, you can start customizing it to fit your project's specific needs. Add additional columns, define task card templates, and explore integrations with other project management tools.

Happy Scrumming!


Scrumboard File Documentaion
=============================

Purpose
-------
The purpose of this JavaScript file is to enable the functionality of a dynamic Scrumboard interface within web applications. By integrating drag-and-drop capabilities and real-time updates, the Scrumboard enhances project visibility, fosters collaboration, and streamlines task management.

Key Components
---------------
1. **Event Listeners**:
   - The file utilizes event listeners to respond to user interactions such as drag-and-drop actions, form submissions, and task modification requests. These listeners ensure seamless functionality and user engagement.

2. **Functions**:
   - **updateTaskStatus(taskId_, status_)**:
     - Updates the status of a task by sending a POST request to the server.
   - **addNewTask(formData)**:
     - Adds a new task to the Scrumboard by submitting form data via a POST request.
   - **modifyTask(formData)**:
     - Modifies an existing task on the Scrumboard by sending form data to the server.
   - **deleteTask(taskId)**:
     - Deletes a task from the Scrumboard by sending a POST request with the task ID to the server.
   - **validateTaskInput(taskInput)**:
     - Validates the input in the task field to enable or disable the add task button based on the input length.
   - **expandTaskDetails(expandButton)**:
     - Toggles the visibility of additional task details when the expand button is clicked.

3. **DOM Manipulation**:
   - DOM manipulation operations handle the dynamic rendering and modification of task elements, form inputs, and task details. These operations contribute to a responsive and intuitive user experience.

4. **Communication**:
   - Communication mechanisms, such as message passing between windows, enable seamless integration with external components or parent applications. These capabilities extend the versatility and interoperability of the Scrumboard.
